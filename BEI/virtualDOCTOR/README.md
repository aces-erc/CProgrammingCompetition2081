## Overview
Virtual Doctor is a sophisticated diagnostic software developed in C that leverages medical data to diagnose illnesses, recommend treatments, generates report file and, if necessary, establish a connection with a physical doctor for further evaluation.
## Features
- **Intelligent Diagnosis:** Utilizes a comprehensive database of symptoms and conditions to provide accurate health assessments.
- **Treatment Suggestions:** Offers medical advice and potential remedies for diagnosed conditions.
- **Doctor Connectivity:** In cases where the virtual diagnosis is inconclusive, the system can connect patients to real-world medical professionals.

## How It Works
1. **Input Symptoms:** Users enter their symptoms into the system.
2. **Analysis:** The software analyzes the input against its medical database.
3. **Diagnosis:** A potential diagnosis is provided based on the analysis.
4. **Treatment:** The system suggests possible treatments.
5. **Referral:** If the system cannot make a definitive diagnosis, it refers the user to a physical doctor.
6. **Generates Report** It generates patient report file (text) which includes patient info , generated date, symptoms and cure;
